10. There is an optional step to complete the Meta verification, which grants the account the green tick in WhatsApp. This is highly recommended if you intend to send WhatsApp messages to a skeptical population and aim to enhance response rates in your surveys. To proceed, click on the "Open Meta Business Verification" button and follow the provided steps.

_After submitting the required formats for approval, please note that it may take approximately one week for everything to be set up. Once your sender is approved, you can proceed to create the WhatsApp profile in the next section._


## WhatsApp Profile

11. Navigate to the newly created sender and provide the necessary information that will be displayed in the profile. This includes adding an image, name, and a description according to your preferences.
